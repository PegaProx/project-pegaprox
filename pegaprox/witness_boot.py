"""What starts the witness (#625 stage 2): it picks the code to run and keeps the way back.

The witness updates itself from its group: the leader's code bundle (ha.witness_bundle),
signed by a data voter, goes next to the code that runs, and the process exits for
systemd or Docker to start it again (witness.py, Witness.run_update); a witness run by
hand starts this file again in place (RUNNER). This file starts it then. No update replaces it, so a bundle that does not come up cannot take the way
back with it: the installer copies it to /opt/pegaprox-witness/boot.py, and in the
Docker image pegaprox_multi_cluster.py runs it for the command `witness`.

Two places hold code:
  base     what was installed by hand: /opt/pegaprox-witness/current (the installer),
           the image's /app, or a checkout
  updates  <state dir>/code/<release>-<digest>, with the links current and previous:
           what the witness unpacked itself, in the state directory or volume it keeps

The newer of the two by release and wire version runs, the base on a tie: a fresh
install or a newer image wins over an older update. Two exceptions: the leader's older
code taken by hand (update --to-leader) runs while it is the code the updates hold, a
newer base or not (mark_down), and code of the base's own release that the witness took
because the leader runs it (a fix under the same release string) wins the tie
(mark_same). Code that never came up healthy here is on trial while there is something
to go back to: it gets TRIES starts of `run`, and the start after that marks it bad,
goes back to the code before it and says so in update.json. The witness marks its code
healthy once it ran SOAK seconds answering on its own port (Witness.upkeep): code that
answers once and fails a little later is still on trial, and every exit before that
counts. A watchdog in RUNNER ends a start on trial that does not answer within
WATCH_UP, or is not healthy within WATCH_OK - code that hangs before its own check
runs; one that never answered spends all of its tries at once. The witness takes no
update to code marked bad by itself. Every other command (status, update, leave, the
installer's checks) runs the code that ran before an update that has not come up yet,
and ends after COMMAND_LIMIT seconds whatever it waits for.

Started as root, it first becomes the owner of the state directory, as the witness
itself does: the updates are written by that user and are never run as root.

Standard library only: nothing is chosen yet when this runs.
